1.) What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

According to my research, here are the 9 tenants of the "Linux Philosophy":

- Small is Beautiful
- Each Program Does One Thing Well
- Prototype as Soon as Possible
- Choose Portability Over Efficiency
- Store Data in Flat Text Files
- Use Software Leverage
- Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leverage and Portability
- Avoid Captive User Interfaces
- Make Every Program a Filter


2.) In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A virtual private server is a virtual machine (vm) sold by an Internet Hosting service as a service that mimics a dedicated server. Some advantages of VPS hosting include Privacy since others can't access your files as there are no other websites on your server, as well as increased customization, and control.


3.) Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

Running programs as root on Linux is comperable to loggin in as Administrator on your personl computer. The damage can be much more difficult to repair, and be potentially devestating to your entire system instead of just to your home directory. You are also more vulnerable to malicious software, since it has full permission.
